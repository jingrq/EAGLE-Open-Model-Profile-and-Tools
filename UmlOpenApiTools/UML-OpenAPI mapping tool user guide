Running the UML-OpenAPI mapping tool takes the following steps.
1.	You need to have JDK7 environment，either Windows or Linux is OK.  If no JDK on your machine, please download and install it. And don’t forget to configure $JAVA_HOME, $CLASSPATH and $PATH. Here is a reference URL for JDK:http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/webnotes/install/index.html
2.	Open the terminal window in your system. If it’s Windows, run "cmd" to open the command line window.
3.	In the command line, go to the directory you put "mapping tool". 
4.	The uml files should be copied to the same folder where you put the "mapping tool". Note that if “a.uml” depends on other files, they need to be copied to the folder as well.
5.	The user can use the following command under this directory to run this tool. 
                    java -jar uml2json.jar
6.	After running the tool, the xxx.json files will be generated by the mapping tool.
